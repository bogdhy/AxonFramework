/**
 * Composes the catalog's event transformations into a single {@link EventTransformerChain}.
 * <p>
 * The chain matches each event by identity and re-applies transformations until none matches, so
 * multi-step version hops compose on their own. A stored v1 {@code CoursePublished} is lifted to v2 and
 * then to v3, and a {@code CourseOffered} is first renamed to {@code CoursePublished} before flowing
 * through those same version hops. Each step matches a different identity, so registration order does
 * not affect the outcome here; the transformations are grouped only for readability.
 * <p>
 * When several transformations could match the same event, the most specific one wins regardless of
 * registration order: an exact {@code from} always beats a predicate, and two transformations claiming
 * the same exact identity are rejected when the chain is built. This chain has a single predicate
 * ({@code WelcomeMessageBetaCleanup}), so no such contest arises.
