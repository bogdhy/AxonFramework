 * Composes the catalog's event transformations into a single
 * {@link EventTransformerChain}. Registration order matters: v1 to v2 must precede
 * v2 to v3 so a stored v1 event reaches a handler as the current shape. The
 * {@code CourseOffered} rename runs first, so a renamed event then flows through the
 * {@link CoursePublished} version chain.
 * <p>
 * The {@code SystemHeartbeat} drop is order-independent: no other transformation matches that
 * event, so it removes the legacy heartbeats from the read stream wherever it sits.
